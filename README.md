# Case Converter App 

## Introduction - Why did I built this?
Hey folks, You might have run into a situation when you are texting/writing something and later on you realise that each word has been written with the First letter as Upper Case. I have commited this mistake multiple times to lay emphasis on certain words while bloging but later I saw that this actually reduces the readability of the users. But going back to the Individual words and changing the cases is a lot of pain. 
So, I came up with a project which will help you out in converting your "not so readable" text to normal cased, readable text.

## Features - How to use it?

Step 1: Go To the [case converter website](https://case-converter-app.netlify.app/)

Step 2: Enter the text / message

>PS: The way this program works is - it divides the paragraphs into sentences and further divides those sentences to words and operates on those words. By default it will capitalise only the first letter of the first word of every sentence (**This is what the program should do**). 

> - If you want another word's first letter to be capitalised remeber to use `/` before the word.  
> For example:  
> Input: ```my Name Is /Eddie /Jaoude```  
> Output: ```My name is Eddie Jaoude.```

> - If you want to make a full word UpperCased, add a prefix of ```:``` before the word  
>For example:  
>Input: ```eddie /jaoude is /the :goat```   
>Output: ```Eddie Jaoude is The GOAT```

Step 3: Press Enter

Step 4: Click on Copy to ClipBoard button

and you are done!
